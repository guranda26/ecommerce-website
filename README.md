# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode using webpack. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches test runner in the interactive watch mode using Jest.

## Running Tests

- To run tests, execute `npm test`.

- To generate and view test coverage reports, execute `npm run test:coverage`. Coverage reports are saved in the `coverage` directory.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production using Vite. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint on the src/ directory. This script checks for linting errors and attempts to automatically fix them.

### `npm run format`

Runs Prettier on files in the src/ directory. This command will format source files to ensure code consistency and style adherence.

### `npm run preview`

This command is intended for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production server.
